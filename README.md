* * *

### How it works

Need to send a secret to someone? Use Fugacious to ensure that no permanent record of your secret will remain. 

1. Visit [fugacio.us](https://fugacio.us)
2. Enter your secret
3. Share your link 

The link to your secret will only remain alive for the preset amount of time or number of views.


### Getting started with development

#### Dependencies
- [Ruby 2](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
- [Redis](https://redis.io)
- [Qt](https://www.qt.io)

### [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

Be sure Docker is running, then

1. Build the environment with:
```
$ docker-compose build
```

2. Start the server
```
$ docker-compose up
```

That's it, the app is running on http://localhost:3000

### Local setup

1. Setup application dependencies
```
$ bin/setup
```

2. Start the app
```
$ foreman start
```

3. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000


### Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Adds some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information

### Deploying to Heroku

##### Use this friendly button:
[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/fugacious/fugacious)

##### Or, use our friendly bootstrap script:
Ensure you have the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line) installed.

1. Execute Heroku setup with `bin/heroku`. Your shell output should look something [like this](https://gist.github.com/amoose/a955ec21a085ab087641044240314abb) and once successfully launched, will open your new Fugacious instance!

### Operators

Fugacious URLs should be treated as sensitive information since knowing the URL
could allow someone to access the stored secret (assuming it was accessed
within the time-to-live of the secret). This means you should be careful about
how you configure your HTTP server. Many have a default configuration to log
all requests, including these sensitive URLs, to file or to stdout. Most PaaS,
like Heroku or Cloud Foundry are configured this way, too.

Operators of fugacious should take this into consideration when setting up
their app. Otherwise, they will potentially be disclosing sensitive information
to their hosting providers.
