We hope that you will consider contributing to Toaster. You can contribute in many ways. For example, you might:

* add documentation and "how-to" articles to the README or Wiki.
* create new features or new integrations
* fix bugs in the GitHub issue tracker
* improve and/or add new I18n translations

When contributing to Toaster, we ask that you:

* let us know what you plan in the GitHub issue tracker so we can provide feedback.
* provide tests and documentation whenever possible. It is very unlikely that we will accept new features or functionality into Toaster without the proper testing and documentation. When fixing a bug, provide a failing test case that your patch solves.
* open a GitHub pull request with your patches and we will review your contribution and respond as quickly as possible. Keep in mind that this is an open source project, and it may take us some time to get back to you. Your patience is very much appreciated.
