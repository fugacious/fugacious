        title: An official website of the United States government
        expand_link: Here's how you know
        official_title: The .gov means it’s official.
        how_you_know: Federal government websites always use a .gov or .mil domain. Before sharing sensitive information online, make sure you’re on a .gov or .mil site by inspecting your browser’s address (or "location") bar.
        ssl_text_html: This site is also protected by an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate that’s been signed by the U.S. government. The <strong>https://</strong> means all transmitted data is encrypted  — in other words, any information or browsing history that you provide is transmitted securely.

        p1: "%{app_name} is a way to securely send temporary passwords, keys, or tokens."
        p2: "Why is this secure?"
        p3: "When you send someone a password, installation token, or other account credentials  through email, that information most likely stays in a user’s email archives forever, as well as in your own sent mail folder. If their email account or yours gets hacked at any point, the hackers also have access to that password."
        p4: "%{app_name} adds an additional layer of security by ensuring that any record of the password gets deleted after a set period of time or a set number of views. This means that anyone who might gain access to someone’s email after the message expires will only find the expired %{app_name} link and will have no way to access the secret credentials."
