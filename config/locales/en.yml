# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        p2: "Why is this secure?"
        p3: "When you send someone a password, installation token, or other account credentials  through email, that information most likely stays in a user’s email archives forever, as well as in your own sent mail folder. If their email account or yours gets hacked at any point in the future, the hackers also have that password."
        p4: "Fugacious adds an additional layer of security by ensuring that any record of the password gets deleted after a set period of time or a set number of views. That means that anyone who might gain access to someone’s email after the message expires will only find the expired Fugacious link, and will have no way to access the secret credentials!"
